# WiFi Energy Monitor for electromechanical induction watt-hour meters ('Ferraris-ZÃ¤hler')

## Usage
The board has a RESTfull http interface which returns all data as json objects.
There is an API description in [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) format in the folder `api`. 
Use the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to open. The editor also allows you to generate client code 
to access the API from the runtime/language of your choice.
